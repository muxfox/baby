# MovieBox API

A complete Node.js Express API server that provides full access to MovieBox content through RESTful endpoints. Successfully converted from the original Python moviebox-api library with all endpoints functional and real download links working.

## Features

- **Real Movie & TV Search** - Search the complete MovieBox database with live results
- **Detailed Information** -  Get comprehensive movie/series metadata including cast, ratings, descriptions
- **Working Download Links** - Access real download sources in multiple qualities (360p - 1080p)
- **Trending Content** - Live trending movies and TV series data
- **Homepage Content** - Featured movies and recommendations
- **Download Proxy** - Bypass CDN restrictions with automatic header injection
- **Mobile Authentication** - Uses mobile app headers for authentic data access
- **Region Bypass** - Circumvents geo-blocking restrictions

## API Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON responses with real MovieBox data.

### Download Proxy
```
GET /api/download?url=[video-url]&title=[title]&quality=[quality]&season=[season]&episode=[episode]
```
Proxy endpoint that adds proper headers to bypass CDN restrictions for direct downloads. Automatically generates descriptive filenames based on metadata.

**Filename Format:**
- **Movies:** `Title_Quality.mp4` (e.g., `Avatar_1080p.mp4`)
- **TV Shows:** `Title_S01E01_Quality.mp4` (e.g., `Wednesday_S01E01_1080p.mp4`)

**Note:** Download URLs with proper metadata are automatically generated in the sources endpoint response.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Dependencies

- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Axios** - HTTP client with cookie jar support
- **Cheerio** - HTML parsing (for future features)
- **tough-cookie** - Cookie management
- **axios-cookiejar-support** - Session handling

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- Uses mobile app headers (`okhttp/4.12.0`) for authentic access
- Session cookie management for API authentication
- Automatic session initialization and maintenance

### Region Bypass
- IP spoofing headers to circumvent geo-blocking
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for different regions
- Supports global access to content

### Download Proxy
- Automatic header injection for CDN access
- Stream-based proxying for large video files (no timeout limits)
- Bypasses browser restrictions with proper referer headers
- Descriptive filenames with title, season, episode, and quality information
- HTTPS URL generation for secure downloads
- Proper error handling and stream cleanup for interrupted downloads

### API Compatibility
- Maintains compatibility with original Python moviebox-api
- Real MovieBox data from `h5.aoneroom.com` and related domains
- Access to CDN resources at `valiw.hakunaymatata.com`

## Usage Examples

### Search for Movies
```javascript
// Search for Avatar movies
fetch('/api/search/avatar')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.data.items));
```

### Get Movie Details
```javascript
// Get Avatar movie information
fetch('/api/info/8906247916759695608')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.data.subject));
```

### Get Download Sources
```javascript
// Get Avatar movie download links
fetch('/api/sources/8906247916759695608')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Access both direct and proxy URLs
    data.data.processedSources.forEach(source => {
      console.log(`${source.quality}: ${source.proxyUrl}`);
    });
  });

// Get TV episode download links (Wednesday Season 1 Episode 1)
fetch('/api/sources/9028867555875774472?season=1&episode=1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Access episode download sources
    data.data.processedSources.forEach(source => {
      console.log(`Episode S1E1 ${source.quality}: ${source.proxyUrl}`);
    });
  });
```

## Response Format

All endpoints return responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Endpoint-specific data
  }
}
```

Error responses:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

## Development

The API is built as a single-file Express application (`index.js`) for simplicity and ease of deployment. All routes, middleware, and helper functions are contained within this file.

### Key Components

- **Session Management** - Automatic cookie handling for API authentication
- **Request Wrapper** - Centralized API request handling with proper headers
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error responses and logging
- **CORS Support** - Cross-origin requests enabled for web applications

## Deployment

### Option 1: Cloudflare Workers (Recommended for Large Files)

**Best for streaming and downloading large video files without timeout issues.**

#### Why Cloudflare Workers?

- ✅ **No timeout limits** - Downloads can run for hours as long as the user stays connected
- ✅ **Resumable downloads** - Users can pause and resume downloads using HTTP range requests
- ✅ **No file size limits** - Stream files of any size (1GB, 5GB, 10GB+) without buffering
- ✅ **Global CDN** - Fast access worldwide with automatic edge caching
- ✅ **Works on slow networks** - No interruptions for users with poor connections
- ✅ **Efficient streaming** - No memory buffering, passes data directly through

#### Setup Cloudflare Workers

1. **Install Wrangler CLI** (Cloudflare's deployment tool):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**:
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

That's it! Your API will be live on Cloudflare's global network with a URL like:
`https://moviebox-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

#### Key Features of Cloudflare Version

- **Streaming optimized**: Uses native `fetch()` API with `response.body` streaming
- **No buffering**: Large files never loaded into memory
- **Resumable downloads**: Full HTTP range request support on `/api/download`
- **No dependencies**: Pure JavaScript, no npm packages needed
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically

#### Resumable Downloads

When users download large files:
1. If they pause or lose connection, the download stops
2. When they click "Resume", the browser requests the remaining bytes
3. The worker serves only the missing part (e.g., "bytes 5000000-end")
4. Download continues from where it left off

This works automatically - no code changes needed!

### Option 2: Traditional Node.js Hosting

The Express version is ready for deployment on any Node.js hosting platform:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Set `PORT` environment variable if needed (defaults to 5000)
3. Start with `npm start` or `node index.js`

#### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)
- `MOVIEBOX_API_HOST` - Override default API host if needed

#### Note on Traditional Hosting

Most Node.js hosts have timeout limits (30-60 seconds), which may interrupt large downloads. For the best user experience with large video files, Cloudflare Workers is recommended.
